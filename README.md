# Advanced Program Manager

## Implemented Functionalities

- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Example**: This functionality demonstrates how to communicate between a parent and child process using pipes.
  
- **Command Execution in Thread**: Allows the execution of a shell command in a separate thread.

- **Process Creation and Listing**: Demonstrates how to create a new process running a given command and how to list all running processes.

- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: A multi-threaded solution to the classic producer-consumer problem using a queue.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/dweismanEDU/472Project1)>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

## How to Use

1. Run the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Execute Commands.

## Test Results

### IPC Example

![IPC Example Figure]("path")

Explanation: This test demonstrates how the parent process reads a message sent by the child process using pipes.

### Command Execution in Thread

Explanation: The test shows the execution of a command in a separate thread without blocking the main thread.

### Process Creation and Listing

Explanation: This test showcases the creation of a new process and then lists all currently running processes.

### Producer-Consumer Problem

Explanation: The producer-consumer test demonstrates how items are produced and consumed using threads and a queue, ensuring synchronization.

## Discussion on the Project Results

This project helped me gain insight into the creation of an advanced process manager with process synchronization. I deepened my understanding of Python's threading capabilities and the synchronization techniques needed to ensure data consistency. Despite facing several challenges along the way, such as unexpected errors and the need for precise synchronization, I was able to troubleshoot them and come up with a functional implementation. This project truly helped me gain a greater understanding for the topic.
